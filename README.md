### [+] Description
Hello, I'm William and these are my submissions for my Gold Badge in C#. Included in this repository is three applications each serving a different purpose which will be listed below. 

### [+] cafe
The Cafe application will allow you to create a Menu for their restaurant. You will be able to add and delete meals from the menu. 

### [+] greenplan
The Green Plan app will allow you to add cars to the list including their Make, Model, MSRP, and Safety Rating. Once cars have been added you can assign the vehicles to a class of Electric, Gas, or Hybrid.  

### [+] outings
The Outings app will allows you to create company outings, such as bowling or concerts. It will take how many people attended the event, how much the event cost and give you a total cost for the event. The app also allows you to see the total cost of events by a specific type (such as golfing) or a total of all the outings.
